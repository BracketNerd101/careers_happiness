Working with a small team helped me see all the in andouts of being a designer. Giving a formal presentation and explaining design desitions in a real world setting were some of the few accomplishments at this point in my career.</p>

               <p class="body_type_style lead">Visual Web design has opened a whole new world to me. I've created work for fortune 500 companies and heavy hitters that affect society. Ive designed mobile apps, landing pages and worked with large css libraries. This by far has been the biggest career boost to my brand. <br><br> Ive learned about all the major sections of web design and UX design. These may seem like the same thing; however are the two parts that make up the visual experience of a website. After 4 years of professional work I have been fulfilled as a designer  and have learned to use Sketch, photoshop, Illustrator and Adobe XD. Lastly it has opened up the door to Front End Development.

               <h1 class="career_type_style">Front-End Design.</h1>
               <p class="body_type_style lead">Learning to code has been a journey in its self. First I thought coding a statif page was the best. However, much like many things you learn, once you start down a path of interest you learn that there is so much more to learn. <br><br> Now that I learned becoming a better web designer comes from learning Front-End Development. Now I can safely say I understand how to talk , translate design and work with developers more effectivly. This has increased my value and confidence as a designer. Git ,Branches, Repos and text editors have become part of my tools in my bag of tricks. <br>
                  Lastly I can say that I have started and completed more that a 15 micro websites that are fully responsive. Utilizing CSS libraries like bootstrap, Foundation, Sematic UI and other modular frameworks. Now I can create and share ideas with the masses about other ventures. Hopefully I can continue to grow this skill set and create some interactive websites that illustrate some educational app games that I could show to venture capitalist.
